## Notes

I've learned how to design sleek user interfaces using Storyboard and Interface Builder, making it easier to lay out elements with AutoLayout constraints. By connecting UI elements to code using IBOutlet and IBAction, I can seamlessly link user interactions to backend functionality. Additionally, I've created a robust data model to organize and display information within the app. These skills have enabled me to craft intuitive and visually appealing experiences for users.
